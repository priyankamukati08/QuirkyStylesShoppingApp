To make changes to the codebase in a collaborative manner, follow:

1. be on your main branch:
   `git checkout main`

2. pull latest main branch changes:
   `git pull origin main`

3. create a feature branch:
   `git checkout -b new_feature_branch_name`

4. add your changes:
   `git add .`

5. make a commit of your changes:
   `git commit -m "your change description"`

6. push your changes to git cloud:
   `git push origin new_feature_branch_name`

7. to check git status anytime:
   `git status`

8. now create a pull request (PR) by going to github.com and add reviewers

9. once a reviewer finds the changes to be good they can then merge the PR
10. now everyone can see your changes in the main branch
